# üß± SCD Type 2 Tool ‚Äì When and Why

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem ‚Äì Fake Data, False Decisions

Most analytical models must preserve a **history of changes** in dimension records. For example:
- Customers moving from one city to another
- Products being renamed or reclassified
- Regions being reorganized
- Pricing evolving over time

Without **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2** logic, you‚Äôre not just missing history ‚Äî you‚Äôre introducing **false information** into your analytics.

> üî• Imagine this:  
> A customer buys a bicycle while living in Rome.  
> A year later, they move to London.  
> If you overwrite the customer‚Äôs address without preserving history, every historical order ‚Äî including that bicycle purchase ‚Äî will now show up as being from **London**, not Rome.  
> 
> ‚ùóThat‚Äôs not outdated data. That‚Äôs **fake data**.

It gets worse: You may be basing strategic decisions, KPI dashboards, and machine learning models on **data that never actually happened**.

Now ask yourself:
- How many similar **invisible errors** might already exist in your model?
- How many facts are now tied to **wrong dimensions** because history was lost?
- How many customer, product, or region changes have silently corrupted your historical insight?

## ‚úÖ Why this tool matters

Implementing SCD Type 2 logic manually is tedious, complex, and highly error-prone:
- You must detect changes precisely
- Expire old versions correctly (using end dates)
- Insert new versions with valid timeframes
- Maintain surrogate key consistency

This tool automates all of that for you.

You simply provide:
- The current state of the dimension table
- A new snapshot (e.g., today's version)

The tool will:
- Compare based on natural keys and tracking columns
- Insert a new row **only when something changed**
- Expire the old row with the correct `EndDateTime`
- Keep your dimension table **historically accurate and trustworthy**

## üìÖ When to use it

Use this tool in **any dimensional model** where past and present states coexist ‚Äî especially in:

- Customer dimensions (addresses, status, segments)
- Product dimensions (categories, brands, SKUs)
- Organizational structures (region, branch, territory)
- Any table where history matters and overwriting records would cause **data lies**

If you‚Äôre using Power BI or any other BI tool, incorrect dimensions don‚Äôt just pollute your data ‚Äî they corrupt the stories your dashboards tell.

‚úÖ Don‚Äôt risk making decisions based on a version of history that **never happened**.
