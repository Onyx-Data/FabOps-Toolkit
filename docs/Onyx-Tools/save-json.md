# ðŸ“¥ Save JSON Tool â€“ When and Why

## ðŸ§© Problem â€“ Can You Prove What Was Ingested?

In modern data architectures like the **Medallion architecture**, raw data is ingested and passed through multiple stages of transformation â€” from raw to bronze, silver, and gold layers. By the time the data reaches the BI dashboards or analytical models, it may be **deeply transformed, filtered, aggregated, or joined**.

Now imagine a scenario where someone questions the accuracy of a dashboard number:
- Why is this customer missing?
- Why does this total seem too low?
- Why is the format of this field inconsistent?

To answer those questions, you must **trace the data lineage** back to the moment it was first received â€” and thatâ€™s only possible if you kept a precise copy of the **raw ingested data**.

Without it, you're stuck:
- Guessing whether the data arrived malformed
- Re-ingesting (if the API even allows it)
- Struggling to reconstruct what the pipeline actually received

## âœ… Why this tool matters

The **Save JSON Tool** solves this gap by letting you **persist the raw data** exactly as it was received from the source â€” before any transformation or parsing occurs.

It enables:
- Full traceability and data lineage across all transformation layers
- Post-mortem investigations
