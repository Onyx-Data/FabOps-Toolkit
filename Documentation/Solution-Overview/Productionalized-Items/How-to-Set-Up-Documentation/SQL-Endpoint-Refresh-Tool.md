# How to Set Up the SQL Endpoint Refresh System:

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for setting up and integrating the "SQL Endpoint Refresh System." This solution programmatically ensures that the SQL endpoint of a Lakehouse is synchronized with the latest data, thereby preventing downstream delays and disruptions.



## Setting Parameters

Before execution, user must define the following parameters in the notebook's initial cell. These parameters are tagged for easy identification and management.
*   `SQLendpoint_ID`: The unique identifier of the SQL analytics endpoint to be refreshed. This is the target of the synchronization.
*   `workspace_ID`: The unique identifier of the workspace containing the SQL endpoint.


**Parameters Cell:**


    SQLendpoint_ID = "xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx" 
    workspace_ID = "XXXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXXX"   




## Perform the Concurrency Check:

The notebook queries the `SQLEndpointsRefreshCalls` Delta table to check for any in-progress refresh operations for the same `SQLendpoint_ID` within the last 30 minutes.





 If the `progressState` of the most recent batch is "inProgress," the notebook exits using `mssparkutils.notebook.exit(0)` to prevent a new refresh from being triggered. This is a critical feature to prevent redundant or conflicting refresh operations.


## Refresh Operation

If no active refresh is detected, the notebook proceeds to trigger a new metadata refresh.


## Logging the Operation

After successfully triggering the refresh, the notebook logs the request details to the `SQLEndpointsRefreshCalls` Delta table.
## Integration and Triggering

This NoteBook can be executed within other data ingestion notebooks after the main data processing cells have completed their execution. This ensures that a metadata refresh is triggered immediately after new data is added to the Lakehouse.
